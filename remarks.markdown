### Remarks

Just run it with no argument:

    ruby entry.rb

I confirmed the following implementations/platforms:

* ruby 3.4.1 (2024-12-25 revision 48d4efcb85) +PRISM [arm64-darwin24]

### Description

The program is inspired by Ehime Prefecture, the location of this year's RubyKaigi, which is known for its specialty
product, mikan (mandarin oranges).
This program is an ASCII-art-based script written in Ruby that derives the string "Hello! Ehime🍊" from the characters
of "愛媛県" using string manipulations, arithmetic operations, and bitwise operations. The program features numerical
transformations and encoding processes. Due to its ASCII-art-based obfuscation, understanding the code’s intent at a
glance is challenging, but this adds to the fun of analysis and presents an exciting challenge.

### Internals

### Internals of the Program

The program is an obfuscated Ruby script that performs various calculations and manipulations on numeric values derived
from the string "愛媛県" (Ehime Prefecture). It uses a combination of bitwise operations, string manipulations, and
arithmetic operations to generate a result.

### Algorithms Used

1. **Bitwise Operations**: The program uses bitwise right shift operations (`>>`) on numeric values.
2. **String Manipulation**: It converts characters to their ordinal values using `ord` and performs various string
   operations such as splitting and joining.
3. **Arithmetic Calculations**: The script performs multiple arithmetic operations, including summation, division, and
   modulo.
4. **Dynamic Method Invocation**: The program dynamically constructs and invokes method names using the `send` method.
5. **Encoding Transformations**: It includes encoding transformations, possibly related to character encoding.

### Obfuscation Techniques

1. **Avoiding Explicit Numbers**: The program avoids using explicit numbers, instead deriving values through
   calculations
   and transformations, adding another layer of complexity.
2. **ASCII Art**: The program uses ASCII art to further obfuscate the code, making it visually complex and harder to
   interpret
3. **Whitespace and Formatting**: The code is formatted in a way that makes it difficult to read, with unusual spacing
   and line breaks.
4. **Complex Expressions**: The program uses complex and nested expressions to obscure its logic.
5. **Dynamic Code Execution**: The use of `eval` and dynamic method invocation adds to the obfuscation, making it
   challenging to trace the program flow.

### Limitation

* Nothing
